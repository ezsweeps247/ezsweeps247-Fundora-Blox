THIS GAME IS A skill based GAMBLING GAME. CAN YOU DIG DEEP? Overview 3Box is a skill-based online block stacking game released around 2012-2013, often categorized as a gambling game due to its real-money betting mode. It involves timing-based stacking of moving blocks to build a tower, with increasing difficulty as the stack grows. The game can be played for free (practice mode) or with real stakes for cash or prizes. It's available as a web game or app, primarily in German-speaking regions, and emphasizes manual dexterity and concentration over pure luck. Gameplay Mechanics  Core Loop: After starting a round, blocks move back and forth horizontally across a grid-based field. The player presses a "STOP" button (or equivalent) at the precise moment to drop and stack the block onto the one below. Successfully stacked blocks form the base for the next row; missed or overhanging blocks fall off and are lost. Stacking Rules: The field is divided into rows. Stacked blocks in one row become the foundation for the next. The game ends if no blocks are successfully stacked in a row (all fall) or if the player chooses to stop and collect winnings. Difficulty Progression: Block speed increases with each higher row, making timing harder. The free mode is slower and easier for practice; real-money mode is faster and more challenging. Visual Elements (from screenshots and descriptions): A central grid shows the stack (e.g., red blocks). Multipliers are displayed on the side (e.g., x1, x2, x5, x10, x100, up to x1000 or more in higher levels). Balances for credits (SC), premium points (GC), and bet amount are shown. Buttons include "Start", "Stop Blocks", and bet selection.  Betting and Winning  Modes: Free play (100% risk-free, unlimited rounds) or real-money mode (requires account registration and deposit, e.g., via PaysafeCard). Betting System: Select a stake per round (e.g., SC0.10 to SC1.00 or SC5.00 and SC10.00). The potential win is the stake multiplied by the achieved height's multiplier. Multipliers and Payouts: Wins scale with stack height (e.g., x1 for low stacks, up to x100 for a SC1 bet yielding SC100, or higher like x250-x1000 in advanced levels). Colored multipliers indicate cash wins; white ones give premium points redeemable for prizes (e.g., electronics via Amazon). The "win line" is the highest row with at least one successful stack. Winning Conditions: Reach a high stack without total failure. Cash out by stopping at any point or auto-end on loss. Prizes require identity verification for payouts. Losing Conditions: All blocks in a row fall off, ending the round and forfeiting the bet.  Tips and Strategies  Start in free mode to practice timing. Stack at the edges (left or right) for better control, rather than the center. Divide the field into sections: Build with 3 blocks low, then 2, then 1 to minimize speed increases. Take breaks every 20-40 minutes to maintain focus. Set personal bet limits and track deposits to avoid overspending. Community notes: Early levels are easier; higher ones may feel "laggy" or unpredictable in real-money mode.  Potential Risks and Notes  As a gambling game, it carries addiction risks; players report quick losses (e.g., SC20 in an hour) and suspicions of manipulation (e.g., blocks slipping post-stop in high-stake rounds). Cheats exist (e.g., bots reaching level 15), but they're detectable and unreliable in real-money play. Always play on verified sites; the game is skill-based but outcomes can feel luck-dependent due to speed ramps.  but needs to incorporate a provably fair rng engine that's transparent so the outcome of the win can be verified by the user. there must be 2 different game mode which the user can select to play for real money and the other play to win mode. each mode should have an adjustable rtp% & difficulty settings through railways backend link to be accessible anywhere server backend for the win outcome for each prize tier. Also must be compatible with a plug and play style integration with a few other host platform. use modern styling. must make sure all reference to real money stays out and in place fo all that referencing real money. replace all euro and $ With SC and GC . users can change their wager starting form SC1 - 100. users can toggle the stop button with either their mobile device using their fingers or by using their keyboards spacebar on a desktop pc. the screenshot show you the gridlines must have a 14 rows and 7 columns. user stacks should have 3 coluns
